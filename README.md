# Tourney2024Scripts
 Script for the organization of the LCKC 2024 Korfball Tournament

## TODO List

- [x] Try out eslint
- [x] Remove eslint (I hate it. I hate the fact that I thought it would be better)
- [x] Be cool
- [x] Create issues for all of these so they're linked here
- [ ] Maybe format into folders so we have a little bit of a better structure within the code. This only makes sense if it's getting a bit too complex. So will not yet.
