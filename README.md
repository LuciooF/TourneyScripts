# Tourney2024Scripts
 Script for the organization of the LCKC 2024 Korfball Tournament

## TODO List

- [x] Try out eslint
- [x] Remove eslint (I hate it. I hate the fact that I thought it would be better)
- [ ] Create constants for colours
- [ ] Figure out clearing the players sheet for each club (Only have to clear from row 6 and only clear text)
- [ ] Fix bug in lions feed sheet
- [ ] Investigate and think about how to deal with food requirements
- [ ] Create last spreadsheet (which is very similar to lions feed but for us)
- [ ] Find the reference to the other spreadsheet we should create (Matt mentioned but I lost the sheet)
- [x] Be cool
- [] Actually write a readme so other people can understand
- [] Write some documentation for the functions. Use AI for this, please.
- [] Maybe format into folders so we have a little bit of a better structure within the code. This only makes sense if it's getting a bit too complex. So will not yet.
