# Tourney2024Scripts
 Script for the organization of the LCKC 2024 Korfball Tournament

## TODO List

- [x] Try out eslint
- [x] Remove eslint (I hate it. I hate the fact that I thought it would be better)
- [x] [Create constants for colours](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/1)
- [ ] [Figure out clearing the players sheet for each club (Only have to clear from row 6 and only clear text)](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/2)
- [ ] [Fix bug in lions feed sheet](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/3)
- [ ] [Investigate and think about how to deal with food requirements](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/4)
- [ ] [Create last spreadsheet (which is very similar to lions feed but for us)](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/5)
- [ ] Find the reference to the other spreadsheet we should create (Matt mentioned but I lost the sheet)
- [x] Be cool
- [ ] [Actually write a readme so other people can understand](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/6)
- [ ] [Write some documentation for the functions. Use AI for this, please.](https://github.com/LuciooF/Tourney2024Scripts/issues/7)
- [ ] Maybe format into folders so we have a little bit of a better structure within the code. This only makes sense if it's getting a bit too complex. So will not yet.
- [x] Create issues for all of these so they're linked here
